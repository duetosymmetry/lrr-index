One way to impose a restriction is to consider solutions satisfying a given symmetry condition. There are many possible choices, but the present article is concerned with one particular choice, which we shall refer to as Gowdy symmetry. We begin by explaining the origin and meaning of this symmetry type, which has been used as a simplifying assumption in various contexts, some of which we shall mention. Nevertheless, the subject of interest here is strong cosmic censorship. Consequently, after having described what the Gowdy class of spacetimes is, we describe, as seen from the perspective of a mathematician, what is meant by strong cosmic censorship. The existing results on cosmic censorship are based on a detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior of solutions. This analysis is in part motivated by conjectures, such as the BKL conjecture, which we shall therefore briefly describe. However, the emphasis of the article is on the mathematical analysis of the asymptotics, due to its central importance in the proof and in the hope that it might be of relevance more generally.

However, this is useless if the thermal noise remains at the current level in the 100 Hz spectral region, where mirrors are the main contributors. Moreover, increasing the laser power gives rise to various spurious thermal effects in the same mirrors.

We discuss the current observational evidence for cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars, and low-mass X-ray binaries as well as possible future detection of relativistic binaries with gravitational radiation.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"arXiv"}}],"first_author":{"full_name":"Benacquista, Matthew J.","last_name":"Benacquista","first_name":"Matthew J.","recid":1016798},"control_number":940598,"dois":[{"value":"10.12942/lrr-2013-4"}],"arxiv_eprints":[{"categories":["astro-ph.SR"],"value":"1110.4423"}],"titles":[{"title":"Relativistic Binaries in Globular Clusters"},{"source":"arXiv","title":"Relativistic Binaries in Globular Clusters"}]},"updated":"2023-12-12T10:07:31.621224+00:00","id":"940598","links":{"bibtex":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/940598?format=bibtex","latex-eu":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/940598?format=latex-eu","latex-us":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/940598?format=latex-us","json":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/940598?format=json","cv":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/940598?format=cv","citations":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/?q=refersto%3Arecid%3A940598"}},{"created":"2009-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","metadata":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Adamo, T.M.","last_name":"Adamo"},{"full_name":"Kozameh, C.N.","last_name":"Kozameh"},{"full_name":"Newman, E.T.","last_name":"Newman"}],"publication_info":[{"journal_volume":"12","artid":"6","year":2009,"page_start":"6","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."},{"journal_volume":"15","artid":"1","year":2012,"page_start":"1","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."}],"abstracts":[{"source":"arXiv","value":"Shear-free or asymptotically shear-free null geodesic congruences possess a large number of fascinating geometric properties and to be closely related, in the context of general relativity, to a variety of physically significant affects.

While the formation of binary SBHs during galaxy mergers is almost inevitable, coalescence requires that the separation between binary components first drop by a few orders of magnitude, due presumably to interaction of the binary with stars and gas in a galactic nucleus. This article reviews the observational evidence for binary SBHs and discusses how they would evolve. No completely convincing case of a bound, binary SBH has yet been found, although a handful of systems (e.g. interacting galaxies: remnants of galaxy mergers) are now believed to contain two SBHs at projected separations of roughly one kpc. N-body studies of binary evolution in gas-free galaxies have reached large enough particle numbers to reproduce the slow, diffusive refilling of the binary's loss cone that is believed to characterize binary evolution in real galactic nuclei. While some of the results of these simulations -- e.g. the binary hardening rate and eccentricity evolution -- are strongly $N$-dependent, others -- e.g. the damage inflicted by the binary on the nucleus -- are not. Luminous early-type galaxies often exhibit depleted cores with masses of 1-2 times the mass of their nuclear SBHs, consistent with the predictions of the binary model. Studies of the interaction of massive binaries with gas are still in their infancy, although much progress is expected in the near future. Binary coalescence has a large influence on the spins of SBHs, even for mass ratios as extreme as 10:1, and evidence of spin-flips may have been observed.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"arXiv"}}],"first_author":{"full_name":"Merritt, David","last_name":"Merritt","first_name":"David","recid":1023699},"control_number":661987,"dois":[{"source":"ADS","value":"10.12942/lrr-2005-8"}],"titles":[{"title":"Massive black hole binary evolution"},{"source":"arXiv","title":"Massive Black Hole Binary Evolution"}],"arxiv_eprints":[{"categories":["astro-ph"],"value":"astro-ph/0410364"}]},"updated":"2023-12-13T10:10:51.528564+00:00","id":"661987","links":{"bibtex":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/661987?format=bibtex","latex-eu":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/661987?format=latex-eu","latex-us":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/661987?format=latex-us","json":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/661987?format=json","cv":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/661987?format=cv","citations":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/?q=refersto%3Arecid%3A661987"}},{"created":"2013-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","metadata":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Shibata, Masaru","last_name":"Shibata"},{"full_name":"Taniguchi, Keisuke","last_name":"Taniguchi"}],"publication_info":[{"journal_volume":"14","artid":"6","year":2011,"page_start":"6","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."}],"abstracts":[{"value":"We review the current status of general relativistic studies for the coalescence of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the mathematical and theoretical physics underpinnings of the relativistic (multiple) fluid model.

This approach differs from the ``standard'' text-book derivation of the equations of motion from the divergence of the stress-energy tensor, in that one explicitly obtains the relativistic Euler equation as an ``integrability'' condition on the relativistic vorticity.

Part A of the article deals with general post-Newtonian sources. The exterior field of the source is investigated by means of a combination of analytic post-Minkowskian and multipolar approximations. The physical observables in the far-zone of the source are described by a specific set of radiative multipole moments. By matching the exterior solution to the metric of the post-Newtonian source in the near-zone we obtain the explicit expressions of the source multipole moments. The relationships between the radiative and source moments involve many nonlinear multipole interactions, among them those associated with the tails (and tails-of-tails) of gravitational waves. Part B of the article is devoted to the application to compact binary systems. We present the equations of binary motion, and the associated Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, at the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order beyond the Newtonian acceleration. The gravitational-wave energy flux, taking consistently into account the relativistic corrections in the binary moments as well as the various tail effects, is derived through 3.5PN order with respect to the quadrupole formalism. The binary’s orbital phase, whose prior knowledge is crucial for searching and analyzing the signals from inspiralling compact binaries, is deduced from an energy balance argument.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"Springer"}}],"first_author":{"emails":["blanchet@iap.fr"],"full_name":"Blanchet, Luc","last_name":"Blanchet","first_name":"Luc","recid":1016196},"control_number":2853709,"dois":[{"source":"Springer","value":"10.12942/lrr-2006-4"}],"titles":[{"source":"Springer","title":"Gravitational Radiation from Post-Newtonian Sources and Inspiralling Compact Binaries"}]},"updated":"2025-01-14T08:35:18.288391+00:00","id":"2853709","links":{"bibtex":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2853709?format=bibtex","latex-eu":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2853709?format=latex-eu","latex-us":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2853709?format=latex-us","json":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2853709?format=json","cv":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2853709?format=cv","citations":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/?q=refersto%3Arecid%3A2853709"}},{"created":"2003-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","metadata":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Stairs, Ingrid H.","last_name":"Stairs"}],"publication_info":[{"journal_volume":"6","artid":"5","year":2003,"page_start":"5","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."}],"abstracts":[{"source":"arXiv","value":"Pulsars of very different types - isolated objects, and binaries with short- and long-period orbits, white-dwarf and neutron-star companions - provide the means to test both the predictions of general relativity and the viability of alternate theories of gravity.

These dynamical interactions can alter the evolution of individual stars and can produce tight binary systems containing one or two compact objects. In this review, we discuss the theoretical models of globular cluster evolution and binary evolution, techniques for simulating this evolution which lead to relativistic binaries, and current and possible future observational evidence for this population. Globular cluster evolution will focus on the properties that boost the production of hard binary systems and on the tidal interactions of the galaxy with the cluster, which tend to alter the structure of the globular cluster with time. The interaction of the components of hard binary systems alters the evolution of both bodies and can lead to exotic objects. Direct N-body integrations and Fokker-Planck simulations of the evolution of globular clusters that incorporate tidal interactions and lead to predictions of relativistic binary populations are also discussed.

In the near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force that prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background spacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because of its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But it is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no force on the particle -- its only effect is to contribute to the particle's inertia. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully responsible for the self-force. Because this field satisfies a homogeneous wave equation, it can be thought of as a free (radiative) field that interacts with the particle; it is this interaction that gives rise to the self-force. The mathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime are developed here from scratch. The review begins with a discussion of the basic theory of bitensors (part I). It then applies the theory to the construction of convenient coordinate systems to chart a neighbourhood of the particle's word line (part II). It continues with a thorough discussion of Green's functions in curved spacetime (part III).

The focus in the review is on the systematic use of the conical singularity method. The relations to other known approaches such as 't Hooft's brick wall model and the Euclidean path integral in the optical metric are discussed in detail. The puzzling behavior of the entanglement entropy due to fields which non-minimally couple to gravity is emphasized.

In particular in cosmology one has to deal with initial singularities, i.e., the fact that the backward evolution of a classical spacetime inevitably comes to an end after a finite amount of proper time. This presents a breakdown of the classical picture and requires an extended theory for a meaningful description. Since small length scales and high curvatures are involved, quantum effects must play a role. Not only the singularity itself but also the surrounding spacetime is then modified. One particular theory is loop quantum cosmology, an application of loop quantum gravity to homogeneous systems, which removes classical singularities. Its implications can be studied at different levels. The main effects are introduced into effective classical equations, which allow one to avoid the interpretational problems of quantum theory. They give rise to new kinds of early-universe phenomenology with applications to inflation and cyclic models. To resolve classical singularities and to understand the structure of geometry around them, the quantum description is necessary. Classical evolution is then replaced by a difference equation for a wave function, which allows an extension of quantum spacetime beyond classical singularities. One main question is how these homogeneous scenarios are related to full loop quantum gravity, which can be dealt with at the level of distributional symmetric states.

In each of the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing radiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In the near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force that prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background spacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because of its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But it is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no force on the particle. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully responsible for the self-force. The mathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime are developed here from scratch. The review begins with a discussion of the basic theory of bitensors. It then applies the theory to the construction of convenient coordinate systems to chart a neighbourhood of the particle's word line. It continues with a thorough discussion of Green's functions in curved spacetime. The review presents a detailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion. Because the notion of a point mass is problematic in general relativity, the review concludes with an alternative derivation of the equations of motion that applies to a small body of arbitrary internal structure.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"arXiv"}}],"first_author":{"full_name":"Poisson, Eric","last_name":"Poisson","first_name":"Eric","recid":993093},"control_number":886475,"dois":[{"value":"10.12942/lrr-2011-7"}],"arxiv_eprints":[{"categories":["gr-qc"],"value":"1102.0529"}],"titles":[{"title":"The Motion of point particles in curved spacetime"},{"source":"arXiv","title":"The motion of point particles in curved spacetime"}]},"updated":"2023-07-14T06:42:03.489238+00:00","id":"886475","links":{"bibtex":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/886475?format=bibtex","latex-eu":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/886475?format=latex-eu","latex-us":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/886475?format=latex-us","json":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/886475?format=json","cv":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/886475?format=cv","citations":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/?q=refersto%3Arecid%3A886475"}},{"created":"2019-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","metadata":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Zaffaroni, Alberto","last_name":"Zaffaroni"}],"publication_info":[{"journal_volume":"23","artid":"2","year":2020,"page_start":"2","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."}],"abstracts":[{"source":"Springer","value":"I review some recent progresses in counting the number of microstates of AdS supersymmetric black holes in dimension equal or greater than four using holography.

Loop quantum gravity is a well-developed approach to this problem. It is a mathematically well-defined background-independent quantization of general relativity, with its conventional matter couplings. Today research in loop quantum gravity forms a vast area, ranging from mathematical foundations to physical applications. Among the most significant results obtained so far are: (i) The computation of the spectra of geometrical quantities such as area and volume, which yield tentative quantitative predictions for Planck-scale physics. (ii) A physical picture of the microstructure of quantum spacetime, characterized by Planck-scale discreteness. Discreteness emerges as a standard quantum effect from the discrete spectra, and provides a mathematical realization of Wheeler’s “spacetime foam” intuition. (iii) Control of spacetime singularities, such as those in the interior of black holes and the cosmological one. This, in particular, has opened up the possibility of a theoretical investigation into the very early universe and the spacetime regions beyond the Big Bang. (iv) A derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking black-hole entropy. (v) Low-energy calculations, yielding n-point functions well defined in a background-independent context. The theory is at the roots of, or strictly related to, a number of formalisms that have been developed for describing background-independent quantum field theory, such as spin foams, group field theory, causal spin networks, and others.

The physical observables in the far-zone of the source are described by a specific set of radiative multipole moments. By matching the exterior solution to the metric of the post-Newtonian source in the near-zone we obtain the explicit expressions of the source multipole moments. The relationships between the radiative and source moments involve many non-linear multipole interactions, among them those associated with the tails (and tails-of-tails) of gravitational waves.

We present the equations of binary motion, and the associated Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, at the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order beyond the Newtonian acceleration.

Some significant additions have been incorporated with respect to the previous two versions of this review (2000, 2003), most notably the coverage of general-relativistic MHD, a field in which remarkable activity and progress has occurred in the last few years. Correspondingly, the discussion of astrophysical simulations in general-relativistic hydrodynamics is enlarged to account for recent relevant advances, while those dealing with general-relativistic MHD are amply covered in this review for the first time. The basic outline of this article is nevertheless similar to its earlier versions, save for the addition of MHD-related issues throughout. Hence, different formulations of both the hydrodynamics and MHD equations are presented, with special mention of conservative and hyperbolic formulations well adapted to advanced numerical methods. A large sample of numerical approaches for solving such hyperbolic systems of equations is discussed, paying particular attention to solution procedures based on schemes exploiting the characteristic structure of the equations through linearized Riemann solvers. As previously stated, a comprehensive summary of astrophysical simulations in strong gravitational fields is also presented. These are detailed in three basic sections, namely gravitational collapse, black-hole accretion, and neutron-star evolutions; despite the boundaries, these sections may (and in fact do) overlap throughout the discussion. The material contained in these sections highlights the numerical challenges of various representative simulations. It also follows, to some extent, the chronological development of the field, concerning advances in the formulation of the gravitational field, hydrodynamics and MHD equations and the numerical methodology designed to solve them.

A prominent example is the binary black hole problem within Einstein's theory of gravitation, in which one computes the gravitational radiation emitted from the inspiral of the two black holes, merger and ringdown. Powerful mathematical tools can be used to establish qualitative statements about the solutions, such as their existence, uniqueness, continuous dependence on the initial data, or their asymptotic behavior over large time scales. However, one is often interested in computing the solution itself, and unless the partial differential equation is very simple, or the initial data possesses a high degree of symmetry, this computation requires approximation by numerical discretization. When solving such discrete problems on a machine, one is faced with a finite limit to computational resources, which leads to the replacement of the infinite continuum domain with a finite computer grid. This, in turn, leads to a discrete initial-boundary value problem. The hope is to recover, with high accuracy, the exact solution in the limit where the grid spacing converges to zero with the boundary being pushed to infinity. The goal of this article is to review some of the theory necessary to understand the continuum and discrete initial-boundary value problems arising from hyperbolic partial differential equations and to discuss its applications to numerical relativity; in particular, we present well-posed initial and initial-boundary value formulations of Einstein's equations, and we discuss multi-domain high-order finite difference and spectral methods to solve them.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"arXiv"}}],"first_author":{"full_name":"Sarbach, Olivier","last_name":"Sarbach","first_name":"Olivier","recid":990317},"control_number":1095360,"dois":[{"value":"10.12942/lrr-2012-9"}],"arxiv_eprints":[{"categories":["gr-qc"],"value":"1203.6443"}],"titles":[{"title":"Continuum and Discrete Initial-Boundary-Value Problems and Einstein's Field Equations"},{"source":"arXiv","title":"Continuum and Discrete Initial-Boundary-Value Problems and Einstein's Field Equations"}]},"updated":"2023-12-09T12:52:13.131074+00:00","id":"1095360","links":{"bibtex":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1095360?format=bibtex","latex-eu":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1095360?format=latex-eu","latex-us":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1095360?format=latex-us","json":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1095360?format=json","cv":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1095360?format=cv","citations":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/?q=refersto%3Arecid%3A1095360"}},{"created":"2004-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","metadata":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Ashtekar, Abhay","last_name":"Ashtekar"},{"full_name":"Krishnan, Badri","last_name":"Krishnan"}],"publication_info":[{"journal_volume":"7","artid":"10","year":2004,"page_start":"10","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."}],"abstracts":[{"source":"arXiv","value":"Over the past three decades, black holes have played an important role in quantum gravity, mathematical physics, numerical relativity and gravitational wave phenomenology.

In this framework, evolving black holes are modeled by dynamical horizons and black holes in equilibrium by isolated horizons. We review basic properties of these horizons and summarize applications to mathematical physics, numerical relativity and quantum gravity. This paradigm has led to significant generalizations of several results in black hole physics.

These connections must be developed for LISA to live up to its science potential in these areas.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"arXiv"}}],"first_author":{"affiliations_identifiers":[{"schema":"GRID","value":"grid.444722.3"}],"full_name":"Arun, K.G.","last_name":"Arun","first_name":"K.G.","recid":1032364},"control_number":2076195,"dois":[{"source":"Springer","value":"10.1007/s41114-022-00036-9"},{"material":"publication","source":"arXiv","value":"10.1007/s41114-022-00036-9"}],"arxiv_eprints":[{"categories":["gr-qc"],"value":"2205.01597"}],"titles":[{"source":"Springer","title":"New horizons for fundamental physics with LISA"},{"source":"arXiv","title":"New Horizons for Fundamental Physics with LISA"}]},"updated":"2025-01-24T22:03:44.983765+00:00","id":"2076195","links":{"bibtex":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2076195?format=bibtex","latex-eu":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2076195?format=latex-eu","latex-us":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2076195?format=latex-us","json":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2076195?format=json","cv":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/2076195?format=cv","citations":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/?q=refersto%3Arecid%3A2076195"}},{"created":"2021-08-02T03:01:02.162636+00:00","metadata":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Mandel, Ilya","last_name":"Mandel"},{"full_name":"Broekgaarden, Floor S.","last_name":"Broekgaarden"}],"publication_info":[{"journal_volume":"25","artid":"1","year":2022,"page_start":"1","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."}],"abstracts":[{"source":"Springer","value":"Gravitational-wave detections are enabling measurements of the rate of coalescences of binaries composed of two compact objects—neutron stars and/or black holes.

This system couples Einstein's equations to a kinetic matter model. Kinetic theory has been an important field of research during several decades in which the main focus has been on nonrelativistic and special relativistic physics, i.e., to model the dynamics of neutral gases, plasmas, and Newtonian self-gravitating systems. In 1990, Rendall and Rein initiated a mathematical study of the Einstein-Vlasov system. Since then many theorems on global properties of solutions to this system have been established.

Kinetic theory has been an important field of research during several decades where the main focus has been on nonrelativistic- and special relativistic physics, e.g. to model the dynamics of neutral gases, plasmas and Newtonian self-gravitating systems. In 1990 Rendall and Rein initiated a mathematical study of the Einstein-Vlasov system. Since then many theorems on global properties of solutions to this system have been established.

After a brief introduction to AdS/CFT we argue that semiclassical string energies yield information on the quantum spectrum of the string in the limit of large angular momenta on the S^5. The energies of the folded and circular spinning string solutions rotating on a S^3 within the S^5 are derived, which yield all loop predictions for the dual gauge theory scaling dimensions. These follow from the eigenvalues of the dilatation operator of N=4 super Yang-Mills in a minimal SU(2) subsector and we display its reformulation in terms of a Heisenberg s=1/2 spin chain along with the coordinate Bethe ansatz for its explicit diagonalization. In order to make contact to the spinning string energies we then study the thermodynamic limit of the one-loop gauge theory Bethe equations and demonstrate the matching with the folded and closed string result at this loop order. Finally the known gauge theory results at higher-loop orders are reviewed and the associated long-range spin chain Bethe ansatz is introduced, leading to an asymptotic all-loop conjecture for the gauge theory Bethe equations. This uncovers discrepancies at the three-loop order between gauge theory scaling dimensions and string theory energies and the implications of this are discussed.

Ultimately, the drift was interpreted as a constant sunward deceleration of each particular spacecraft at the level of a_P = (8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^{-10} m/s^2. This apparent violation of the Newton's gravitational inverse-square law has become known as the Pioneer anomaly; the nature of this anomaly remains unexplained. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the physical properties of the anomaly and the conditions that led to its detection and characterization. We review various mechanisms proposed to explain the anomaly and discuss the current state of efforts to determine its nature. A comprehensive new investigation of the anomalous behavior of the two Pioneers has begun recently. The new efforts rely on the much-extended set of radio-metric Doppler data for both spacecraft in conjunction with the newly available complete record of their telemetry files and a large archive of original project documentation. As the new study is yet to report its findings, this review provides the necessary background for the new results to appear in the near future. In particular, we provide a significant amount of information on the design, operations and behavior of the two Pioneers during their entire missions, including descriptions of various data formats and techniques used for their navigation and radio-science data analysis.

In particular in cosmology one has to deal with initial singularities, i.e. the fact that the backward evolution of a classical space-time inevitably comes to an end after a finite amount of proper time. This presents a breakdown of the classical picture and requires an extended theory for a meaningful description. Since small length scales and high curvatures are involved, quantum effects must play a role. Not only the singularity itself but also the surrounding space-time is then modified. One particular realization is loop quantum cosmology, an application of loop quantum gravity to homogeneous systems, which removes classical singularities. Its implications can be studied at different levels. Main effects are introduced into effective classical equations which allow to avoid interpretational problems of quantum theory. They give rise to new kinds of early universe phenomenology with applications to inflation and cyclic models. To resolve classical singularities and to understand the structure of geometry around them, the quantum description is necessary. Classical evolution is then replaced by a difference equation for a wave function which allows to extend space-time beyond classical singularities. One main question is how these homogeneous scenarios are related to full loop quantum gravity, which can be dealt with at the level of distributional symmetric states.

Here, we first review a few outstanding challenges for the dark matter interpretation of mass discrepancies in galaxies, purely based on observations and independently of any alternative theoretical framework. We then show that many of these puzzling observations are predicted by one single relation - Milgrom's law - involving an acceleration constant (or a characteristic surface density) of the order of the square-root of the cosmological constant in natural units. This relation can at present most easily be interpreted as the effect of a single universal force law resulting from a modification of Newtonian dynamics (MOND) on galactic scales.

This is because the noise in the laser light is common to both arms, experiencing exactly the same delay, and thus cancels when it is differenced at the photo detector. In this situation, much lower level secondary noises then set the overall performance. If, however, the two arms have different lengths (as will necessarily be the case with space-borne interferometers), the laser noise experiences different delays in the two arms and will hence not directly cancel at the photo detector. To solve this problem, a technique involving heterodyne interferometry with unequal arm lengths and independent phase-difference readouts has been proposed. It relies on properly time-shifting and linearly combining independent Doppler measurements, and for this reason it has been called time-delay interferometry (TDI). This article provides an overview of the theory, mathematical foundations, and experimental aspects associated with the implementation of TDI. Although emphasis on the application of TDI to the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission appears throughout this article, TDI can be incorporated into the design of any future space-based mission aiming to search for gravitational waves via interferometric measurements.

This system couples Einstein's equations to a kinetic matter model. Kinetic theory has been an important field of research during several decades in which the main focus has been on nonrelativistic and special relativistic physics, {\\it i.e.} to model the dynamics of neutral gases, plasmas, and Newtonian self-gravitating systems. In 1990, Rendall and Rein initiated a mathematical study of the Einstein-Vlasov system. Since then many theorems on global properties of solutions to this system have been established. The Vlasov equation describes matter phenomenologically and it should be stressed that most of the theorems presented in this article are not presently known for other such matter models ({\\it i.e.} fluid models). This paper gives introductions to kinetic theory in non-curved spacetimes and then the Einstein-Vlasov system is introduced.

The main theme of this review is a discussion of the mechanical and optical principles used in the various long baseline systems in operation around the world - LIGO (USA), Virgo (Italy/France), TAMA300 and LCGT (Japan), and GEO600 (Germany/U.K.) - and in LISA, a proposed space-borne interferometer. A review of recent science runs from the current generation of ground-based detectors will be discussed, in addition to highlighting the astrophysical results gained thus far. Looking to the future, the major upgrades to LIGO (Advanced LIGO), Virgo (Advanced Virgo), LCGT and GEO600 (GEO-HF) will be completed over the coming years, which will create a network of detectors with significantly improved sensitivity required to detect gravitational waves. Beyond this, the concept and design of possible future \"third generation\" gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), will be discussed.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"arXiv"}}],"first_author":{"full_name":"Pitkin, Matthew","last_name":"Pitkin","first_name":"Matthew","recid":1055807},"control_number":889763,"dois":[{"value":"10.12942/lrr-2011-5"}],"arxiv_eprints":[{"categories":["astro-ph.IM"],"value":"1102.3355"}],"titles":[{"title":"Gravitational Wave Detection by Interferometry (Ground and Space)"},{"source":"arXiv","title":"Gravitational Wave Detection by Interferometry (Ground and Space)"}]},"updated":"2024-11-28T12:14:55.865824+00:00","id":"889763","links":{"bibtex":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/889763?format=bibtex","latex-eu":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/889763?format=latex-eu","latex-us":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/889763?format=latex-us","json":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/889763?format=json","cv":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/889763?format=cv","citations":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/?q=refersto%3Arecid%3A889763"}},{"created":"2012-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","metadata":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Amaro-Seoane, Pau","last_name":"Amaro-Seoane"}],"publication_info":[{"journal_volume":"21","artid":"4","year":2018,"page_start":"4","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."}],"abstracts":[{"source":"Springer","value":"It is now well-established that a dark, compact object, very likely a massive black hole (MBH) of around four million solar masses is lurking at the centre of the Milky Way.

In this review, we discuss the theoretical models of globular cluster evolution and binary evolution, techniques for simulating this evolution which lead to relativistic binaries, and current and possible future observational evidence for this population. Globular cluster evolution will focus on the properties that boost the production of hard binary systems and on the tidal interactions of the galaxy with the cluster, which tend to alter the structure of the globular cluster with time. The interaction of the components of hard binary systems alters the evolution of both bodies and can lead to exotic objects. Direct $N$-body integrations and Fokker-Planck simulations of the evolution of globular clusters that incorporate tidal interactions and lead to predictions of relativistic binary populations are also discussed.

For example, atmospheric pressure fluctuations generate a gravity-noise foreground in measurements with super-conducting gravimeters. Gravity changes caused by high-magnitude earthquakes have been detected with the satellite gravity experiment GRACE, and we expect high-frequency terrestrial gravity fluctuations produced by ambient seismic fields to limit the sensitivity of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Accordingly, terrestrial gravity fluctuations are considered noise and signal depending on the experiment. Here, we will focus on ground-based gravimetry. This field is rapidly progressing through the development of GW detectors. The technology is pushed to its current limits in the advanced generation of the LIGO and Virgo detectors, targeting gravity strain sensitivities better than 10^-23 Hz^-1/2 above a few tens of a Hz. Alternative designs for GW detectors evolving from traditional gravity gradiometers such as torsion bars, atom interferometers, and superconducting gradiometers are currently being developed to extend the detection band to frequencies below 1 Hz. The goal of this article is to provide the analytical framework to describe terrestrial gravity perturbations in these experiments. Models of terrestrial gravity perturbations related to seismic fields, atmospheric disturbances, and vibrating, rotating or moving objects, are derived and analyzed. The models are then used to evaluate passive and active gravity noise mitigation strategies in GW detectors, or alternatively, to describe their potential use in geophysics.

This is because the noise in the laser light is common to both arms, experiencing exactly the same delay, and thus cancels when it is differenced at the photo detector. In this situation, much lower level secondary noises then set overall performance. If, however, the two arms have different lengths (as will necessarily be the case with space-borne interferometers), the laser noise experiences different delays in the two arms and will hence not directly cancel at the detector. In order to solve this problem, a technique involving heterodyne interferometry with unequal arm lengths and independent phase-difference readouts has been proposed. It relies on properly time-shifting and linearly combining independent Doppler measurements, and for this reason it has been called Time-Delay Interferometry (or TDI). This article provides an overview of the theory and mathematical foundations of TDI as it will be implemented by the forthcoming space-based interferometers such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We have purposely left out from this first version of our ``Living Review'' article on TDI all the results of more practical and experimental nature, as well as all the aspects of TDI that the data analysts will need to account for when analyzing the LISA TDI data combinations.

I assess the prospects of detecting kilonovae following future GW detections of NS-NS/BH-NS mergers in light of the recent follow-up campaign of the LIGO binary BH-BH mergers.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"arXiv"}}],"first_author":{"affiliations_identifiers":[{"schema":"GRID","value":"grid.21729.3f"}],"full_name":"Metzger, Brian D.","last_name":"Metzger","ids":[{"schema":"ORCID","value":"0000-0002-4670-7509"},{"schema":"INSPIRE BAI","value":"B.D.Metzger.1"}],"first_name":"Brian D.","recid":1038918},"control_number":1495184,"dois":[{"value":"10.1007/s41114-017-0006-z"}],"arxiv_eprints":[{"categories":["astro-ph.HE","gr-qc"],"value":"1610.09381"}],"titles":[{"source":"arXiv","title":"Kilonovae"},{"source":"arXiv","title":"The Kilonova Handbook"}]},"updated":"2023-12-12T10:56:30.303511+00:00","id":"1495184","links":{"bibtex":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1495184?format=bibtex","latex-eu":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1495184?format=latex-eu","latex-us":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1495184?format=latex-us","json":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1495184?format=json","cv":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/1495184?format=cv","citations":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/?q=refersto%3Arecid%3A1495184"}},{"created":"2012-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","metadata":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Amendola, Luca","last_name":"Amendola"},{"full_name":"Group, Euclid Theory Working","last_name":"Group"},{"full_name":"Bacon, David","last_name":"Bacon"},{"full_name":"Baker, Tessa","last_name":"Baker"},{"full_name":"Baldi, Marco","last_name":"Baldi"},{"full_name":"Bartolo, Nicola","last_name":"Bartolo"},{"full_name":"Blanchard, Alain","last_name":"Blanchard"},{"full_name":"Bonvin, Camille","last_name":"Bonvin"},{"full_name":"Borgani, Stefano","last_name":"Borgani"},{"full_name":"Branchini, Enzo","last_name":"Branchini"},{"full_name":"Burrage, Clare","last_name":"Burrage"},{"full_name":"Camera, Stefano","last_name":"Camera"},{"full_name":"Carbone, Carmelita","last_name":"Carbone"},{"full_name":"Casarini, Luciano","last_name":"Casarini"},{"full_name":"Cropper, Mark","last_name":"Cropper"},{"full_name":"de Rham, Claudia","last_name":"de Rham"},{"full_name":"di Porto, Cinzia","last_name":"di Porto"},{"full_name":"Ealet, Anne","last_name":"Ealet"},{"full_name":"Ferreira, Pedro G.","last_name":"Ferreira"},{"full_name":"Finelli, Fabio","last_name":"Finelli"},{"full_name":"Garcia-Bellido, Juan","last_name":"Garcia-Bellido"},{"full_name":"Giannantonio, Tommaso","last_name":"Giannantonio"},{"full_name":"Guzzo, Luigi","last_name":"Guzzo"},{"full_name":"Heavens, Alan","last_name":"Heavens"},{"full_name":"Heisenberg, Lavinia","last_name":"Heisenberg"},{"full_name":"Heymans, Catherine","last_name":"Heymans"},{"full_name":"Hoekstra, Henk","last_name":"Hoekstra"},{"full_name":"Hollenstein, Lukas","last_name":"Hollenstein"},{"full_name":"Holmes, Rory","last_name":"Holmes"},{"full_name":"Horst, Ole","last_name":"Horst"},{"full_name":"Jahnke, Knud","last_name":"Jahnke"},{"full_name":"Kitching, Thomas D.","last_name":"Kitching"},{"full_name":"Koivisto, Tomi","last_name":"Koivisto"},{"full_name":"Kunz, Martin","last_name":"Kunz"},{"full_name":"La Vacca, Giuseppe","last_name":"La Vacca"},{"full_name":"March, Marisa","last_name":"March"},{"full_name":"Majerotto, Elisabetta","last_name":"Majerotto"},{"full_name":"Markovic, Katarina","last_name":"Markovic"},{"full_name":"Marsh, David","last_name":"Marsh"},{"full_name":"Marulli, Federico","last_name":"Marulli"},{"full_name":"Massey, Richard","last_name":"Massey"},{"full_name":"Mellier, Yannick","last_name":"Mellier"},{"full_name":"Mota, David F.","last_name":"Mota"},{"full_name":"Nunes, Nelson","last_name":"Nunes"},{"full_name":"Percival, Will","last_name":"Percival"},{"full_name":"Pettorino, Valeria","last_name":"Pettorino"},{"full_name":"Porciani, Cristiano","last_name":"Porciani"},{"full_name":"Quercellini, Claudia","last_name":"Quercellini"},{"full_name":"Read, Justin","last_name":"Read"},{"full_name":"Rinaldi, Massimiliano","last_name":"Rinaldi"},{"full_name":"Sapone, Domenico","last_name":"Sapone"},{"full_name":"Scaramella, Roberto","last_name":"Scaramella"},{"full_name":"Skordis, Constantinos","last_name":"Skordis"},{"full_name":"Simpson, Fergus","last_name":"Simpson"},{"full_name":"Taylor, Andy","last_name":"Taylor"},{"full_name":"Thomas, Shaun","last_name":"Thomas"},{"full_name":"Trotta, Roberto","last_name":"Trotta"},{"full_name":"Verde, Licia","last_name":"Verde"},{"full_name":"Vernizzi, Filippo","last_name":"Vernizzi"},{"full_name":"Vollmer, Adrian","last_name":"Vollmer"},{"full_name":"Wang, Yun","last_name":"Wang"},{"full_name":"Weller, Jochen","last_name":"Weller"},{"full_name":"Zlosnik, Tom","last_name":"Zlosnik"}],"publication_info":[{"journal_volume":"16","artid":"6","year":2013,"page_start":"6","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."}],"abstracts":[{"source":"MPI Grav.

The attempts at a remedy have proved heuristically important for a new systematic type of thermodynamics: Extended thermodynamics. That new theory has symmetric hyperbolic field equations and thus it provides finite pulse speeds.\\n\\nExtended thermodynamics is a whole hierarchy of theories with an increasing number of fields when gradients and rates of thermodynamic processes become steeper and faster. The first stage in this hierarchy is the 14-field theory which may already be a useful tool for the relativist in many applications. The 14 fields — and further fields — are conveniently chosen from the moments of the kinetic theory of gases.\\n\\nThe hierarchy is complete only when the number of fields tends to infinity. In that case the pulse speed of non-relativistic extended thermodynamics tends to infinity while the pulse speed of relativistic extended thermodynamics tends to c, the speed of light.\\n\\nIn extended thermodynamics symmetric hyperbolicity — and finite speeds — are implied by the concavity of the entropy density.

Then we consider the consequences of gravitational wave detections and observations for physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"arXiv"}}],"first_author":{"full_name":"Sathyaprakash, B.S.","last_name":"Sathyaprakash","first_name":"B.S.","recid":990230},"control_number":814540,"dois":[{"value":"10.12942/lrr-2009-2"}],"arxiv_eprints":[{"categories":["gr-qc"],"value":"0903.0338"}],"titles":[{"title":"Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology with Gravitational Waves"},{"source":"arXiv","title":"Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology with Gravitational Waves"}]},"updated":"2024-06-01T19:24:39.008259+00:00","id":"814540","links":{"bibtex":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/814540?format=bibtex","latex-eu":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/814540?format=latex-eu","latex-us":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/814540?format=latex-us","json":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/814540?format=json","cv":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/814540?format=cv","citations":"https://inspirehep.net/api/literature/?q=refersto%3Arecid%3A814540"}},{"created":"2023-03-06T02:42:07.114682+00:00","metadata":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Fienga, Agnès","last_name":"Fienga"},{"full_name":"Minazzoli, Olivier","last_name":"Minazzoli"}],"publication_info":[{"journal_volume":"27","artid":"1","year":2024,"page_start":"1","journal_title":"Living Rev.Rel."}],"abstracts":[{"source":"Springer","value":"We describe here how planetary ephemerides are built in the framework of General Relativity and how they can be used to test alternative theories.

In geophysics, these fluctuations are typically considered as signal that carries information about processes such as fault ruptures and atmospheric density perturbations. In fundamental-physics experiments, it appears as environmental noise, which needs to be avoided or mitigated. This article reviews the current state-of-the-art of modeling high-frequency terrestrial gravity fluctuations and of gravity-noise mitigation strategies. It hereby focuses on frequencies above about 50 mHz, which allows us to simplify models of atmospheric gravity perturbations (beyond Brunt–Väisälä regime) and it guarantees as well that gravitational forces on elastic media can be treated as perturbation. Extensive studies have been carried out over the past two decades to model contributions from seismic and atmospheric fields especially by the gravitational-wave community. While terrestrial gravity fluctuations above 50 mHz have not been observed conclusively yet, sensitivity of instruments for geophysical observations and of gravitational-wave detectors is improving, and we can expect first observations in the coming years. The next challenges include the design of gravity-noise mitigation systems to be implemented in current gravitational-wave detectors, and further improvement of models for future gravitational-wave detectors where terrestrial gravity noise will play a more important role. Also, many aspects of the recent proposition to use a new generation of gravity sensors to improve real-time earthquake early-warning systems still require detailed analyses.","abstract_source_suggest":{"input":"Springer"}}],"first_author":{"affiliations_identifiers":[{"schema":"GRID","value":"grid.466750.6"}],"full_name":"Harms,
